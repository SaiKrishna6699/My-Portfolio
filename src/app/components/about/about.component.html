        <p>
            Before I got into the software development, I am from a small town name Tirupathi, which is a famous temple town housing Lord Venkateswara swamy and home of Seshachalam forest. Ever since I was a kid, I loved making things
            look nice, like designing and painting. I even thought about being an architect at one point. Then, when I
            was 15, I started learning basic programming and ended up switching to Computer Science.
            <br>
            <br>
            I started off with web development, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to understand how websites work. I
            also did side projects to explore my love for design.
            <br>
            <br>
            Outside of work, I have a small group of friends. I enjoy going on long drives, listening to music, and
            exploring new places. I love both snowy mountains and breezy coastlines, and I find peace in nature.
            <br>
            <br>
            I also have a soft spot for both cats and dogs. Overall, my life revolves around technology, design, and
            enjoying the simple things.
